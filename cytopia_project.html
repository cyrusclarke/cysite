				<h1>Cytopia</h1><p>Cytopia or Cyborgs Towards Utopia is a design-fiction investigation that incorporates speculative and narrative methods in order to discover how technology can help make us <i>more</i> human.</p><br/>

				<br />
				<p>In a parallel universe, there exists a world much like our own but with some key changes. Borne out of a schism in the year 1998, this world known as Cytopia, is characterised by three principles for technology:</p><br />
				<b>Technology that helps us to be more human, rather than more efficient.<p>
				Technology driven by creative prowess, not market forces.<p>
				Technology that empowers optimistic thoughts, not hopeless anxiety.</p></b>
				<br />
				The project Cyborgs Towards Utopia explores this world in a Marco Polo-esque fashion in order to bring exotic technological discoveries to the citizens of our world. The initial fieldwork and research involved co-opting the friendly citizens of Cytopia; living breathing cyborgs who are challenging the rigid notions of reality. To facilitate research efforts, Cy Rus designed a game known as <i>Cards for Humanity</i>, to provoke discussion on human differences from animals and indeed machines.<p>
				From this research a broad range of areas for exploration were uncovered on the theme of what makes us human with three topics standing out: awareness, identity and attention. Exploring these topics in the world of Cytopia led to the discovery of a myriad of products and services unique to that world. Three in particular stood out:</p>
				<b>Moo.net</b></p>
				<p>If your attention was currency, would you invest it in Kim Kardashian? In Cytopia, economics has evolved in response to the dramatic effect of the internet on human behaviour. The result is Moo.net, net money for the attention economy.

				</div>
				This decentralised currency gives citizens the ability to monetise their attention online through direct investment, which like any type of investment may generate returns. Citizens may also gain attention through the creation and indeed curation of content, which in a decentralised world is not stocked solely on Facebook or Google.<p>The effect of this kind of currency is to change the rules of the game, the behavioural incentives and ultimately human behaviour.</p>
				<br />
				<p><b>BetaU</b></p>
				<p>Is a smiling emoji really happy? The early internet was full of gender-bending, creative monikers and multiple personas. In our world, identity policing and a standardised yellow alphabet of emotions means that exploration of identity online is reserved for the most eccentric, queer and unorthodox. In Cytopia with a decentralised internet, identity exploration thrives and thousands of services exist to meet citizen demand.

					</div>
				</div>
				One of these is BetaU, a service which helps people uncover and display hidden sides of themselves. Through the use of avatars, people may bring these identities to the superficial layer, available for use online and increasingly offline through augmented reality.</p>
				<br />	
				<p><b>MetaCog</b></p>
				<p>This is a device that promises to make your attention count. Working with the attention economy and with currencies such as Moo.net, MetaCog works intelligently with your mind to understand what you are focusing on. When you consume media online, it measures your attention level, allowing for the seamless investment of attention.<br /></p>

				<br><br>
				<p>Market, societal and behavioural constructs have restricted the development of such products and services in our reality, however Cy Rus was able to use ideas and technologies from our world to prototype versions of the three artefacts for citizens to explore. This involved working with experts in emerging fields like Blockchain and Virtual Reality to develop immersive experiences.</p>
				<p>Using fiction as a device, Cy Rus was able to develop a rich narrative for the world of Cytopia, which is currently taking form as a story entitled <a href="http://www.cytopia.xyz"><i>Cyborgs Towards Utopia</i></a>. The unconventional research and development methods led to the prototyping of a method known as Posthuman Design, which blends conventional human-centred design with a parallel layer of design fiction.<p>This process allowed for prototypes and fictional narrative to be developed simultaneously, informing one another. To bring other designers and non-designers into the process, unconventional Posthuman workshops were held, transporting people to Cytopia using binaural recordings, sensory deprivation, physical relocation and role-play. After their arrival in Cytopia, participants helped to refine and enhance prototypes, discuss the key themes and indeed find their own voice and space to speculate effectively on desirable alternatives to the norm.

				<br />
				<br />At the end of an intense 12 week period of work, Cy Rus sees this project as a starting point in a continued exploration of how technology can make us more human, simultaneously using and developing a Posthuman design process. Exploring what might have been to suggest what still might be. </p>
