					We were interested in giving our natural surroundings the ability to self-express without interference from humans. Rather than simply enhancing the sounds of nature, the team sought to develop a new voice based on a new musical scale that would reflects the full characteristics of a natural object rather than the individual sounds of its various components. Notions of time, a sense of scale and physicality were all important considerations. Using a system of strings emanating from the tree and connected to a specially designed object, we give a new voice to nature.</p><p>
					In many respects our end user is a tree, thus creating an object that fits in with a tree&#39;s natural surroundings and does not require any human manipulation beyond setup was important. In order to do this we decided upon a puppet-like system. When the tree sways with the wind, strings connected to it move four analog joysticks which controls sound outputs.</p>

					We were able to develop an experience that could be adapted to a variety of tree forms and settings producing different results each time. puppeTree is also a great performance piece, where a human can be brought in to play a tree or plant and create music. We even experimented through duets with other experimental musical instruments.</p><p>
					Having decided that sound would be the most compelling medium for expression our initial inspiration came artists like <i>Zimoun</i> and alternative forms of musical notation especially <i>Cornelius Cardew</i>.  Using Processing and the <i>Strom</i> library in conjunction with the <i>BFO synth</i> the team were able to transform these analog inputs and give trees a way to express themselves. The position of each of the four joysticks sends parameter values to Processing via Arduino. In Processing these values are passed to the Strom library, connected to the BFO synth, to trigger a note and sound output.
