					<h1>BetaU</h1><p>
					<p>This morning, while walking through the town which looked eerily similar, I noticed a new shop called BetaU. From its outward appearance, it was really unclear what this store sold, if anything. There was a large, bright yellow sticker on the door which read &ldquo;Helping human dysfunction since 2006&rdquo;. The message came across as slightly anarchistic and was enough to convince me to go inside and take a look.</p><p>The room I found myself in was soberly decorated, not particularly well lit, yet not dark, with a range of tiny, spotlit devices on display in pristine glass cases. The objects appeared to be technological though I was uncertain of their nature. The customers to my left were discussing something called MetaCog, which from their remarks, sounded like a new launch though I could not find it on display anywhere in BetaU.</p><p>The walls were full of brands and product I had never heard of, with names and claims that sounded fantastic in the original sense of the word. The poster that caught my attention was for the aforementioned MetaCog which promised to give people &ldquo;The Power to Choose&rdquo; which seemed ominous though the look and style of the products seemed somehow to resemble the aesthetics of nature. I was trying to make sense of it when I was then approached by a large gentleman with horns protruding from his head. </p><p>He was covered in tattoos, wore black clothing and gave me a warm smile. Still in a state of bemusement from this cell-like choice providing MetaCog, I missed his initial greeting and question. &ldquo;So I&lsquo;ll ask again, what is your dysfunction?&rdquo;</p><p>I stammered out that I was interested in the MetaCog and wanted to learn more about it. Gem&#39;s warning to make sure no one catches on to the fact that I&#39;m a visitor was running through my mind.&ldquo;Well the MetaCog, everyone is asking about that at the moment! I guess it is going to be a popular upgrade, what with it giving us the chance to use our Moonets without clicking!&rdquo;</p><p>Without having time to consider what Moonets were, I decided that I wanted to see how the MetaCog worked and asked for a demo. The large horned man chuckled to himself, &ldquo;Of course you&#39;d like to try it, everyone wants to try it! We don&rsquo;t have any left in stock today but I should be getting some in a couple of days. We can organize an installation if you&#39;re interested?&rdquo;</p><p>An installation? That sounded very strange to me but the manner in which he said it sounded routine. He opened a notebook which I must say I found slightly archaic and took down the name I was using in Cytopia. He asked for a phone number and when I gave it to him he asked if it was an international number. For the sake of simplicity I nodded. I asked for his name and he blurted our Muffe, though I&#39;m not sure of the spelling. </p><p>We shook hands and I left the store none the wiser about MetaCog, Moonets or what this installation would involve. </p>
