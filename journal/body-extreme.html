				Today I talked with Muffe from <a href="http://bodyxtremes.com/home.html">Body Xtremes</a>, the only authorised purveyor of technological implants in Denmark.</p>
				<p>We started out playing <a href="http://cyrus.website/cytopia/cards-for-humanity.html">Cards for Humanity</a>. Muffe was pretty sure that something that defines humans is our ability to be evil, telling me that &ldquo;<i>We</i> are for sure the only thing that can be evil&rdquo;</p><p>His choices reflected a fairly misanthropic view on humanity, summed up by his insistence that &ldquo;As long as there is more than one human being they&#39;re going to fight each other&rdquo;</p><p>I pressed him on whether technology could play a role in transforming his view and indeed humanity, orienting society towards something more positive. Initially he seemed pretty unconvinced, displaying a fairly negative view towards technology, asking me what would happen to a world governed by benevolent machines when a cable breaks.</p><p>Delving a bit deeper he expressed his dismay that we look to technology as a way out. &ldquo;If people can&#39;t figure out to be better to each other by themselves, I can&#39;t figure out how a machine can do it for us.&rdquo;</p><p>I mentioned the idea of a &lsquo;Reset Button&rsquo; that could help us go back and start again from scratch. He maintained a rather gloomy outlook explaining that even after a reset he wasn&#39;t &ldquo;Sure if humans would be so very different if we started out again.&rdquo;</p><p>
				<div id="quotes">&ldquo;As soon as I could find something to use it for, i&#39;d use it&rdquo;</p></div>
				We eventually got on to his own body modifications. He has had a number of modifications and augmentations made including silicon implants. I was mostly interested in the mechanics and the adjustment time for these new parts. He explained that &ldquo;It took 5-6 years until my body learned the new shape of my body&rdquo; </p><p>He lamented a magnet that he had placed square between his eyebrows, telling me that it was &ldquo;A poorly made choice for the implant&rdquo; as there was not enough space for the magnet to sit, so he started to get quite extreme headaches and had to remove the implant after a while.</p>
				<p>Suddenly he exclaimed &ldquo;I have micro-chips in my arm&rdquo; and I realised I was really in the presence of a conventional cyborg. When I asked what he was using it for he quickly replied, &ldquo;Nothing, my idea for having one was having an electronic lock on my house, all it does in reality though is say Muffe is the go-to guy in Copenhagen.&rdquo;</p><p>We discussed why he thought that technological implants ought to be utilitarian compared to some of the other purely aesthetic or perhaps emotional reasons to pursue body modification. He quickly replied that <q>It could be fucking cool to put your arm up and the door unlocks</q> though he did admit that it was tricky right now to find &lsquo;useful&rsquo; stuff to do with his implant.</p><p><p>This led me to start thinking as to whether an interesting exploration could be about designing the infrastructure that makes installing chips useful, rather than simply focusing on new appendages. </p><p>He offered up some interesting perspectives on the &ldquo;New generation of geeks&rdquo; that want to play around with micro-chips &ldquo;and see what they can do&rdquo;. He also pointed to privacy concerns, &ldquo;I also think at some point it will be something they will use to control people with. I think they&#39;re going to use it against us, to control us.&rdquo;</p><p>Our conversation ended with Muffe recouting an amusing story he'd heard about an adapted wheelchair, which was controlled by the movements of the tongue. According to him it worked extremely well, though &ldquo;The user experienced some problems with coughing&rdquo;</p> //
