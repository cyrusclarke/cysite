					<h1>Humans Playing Cards</h1><p>
					<div id="quotes">“Awareness is much more than just intelligence or knowledge, it’s about being conscious”</div>
					<p>The first round of testing has proven to be extremely insightful.<p>Unexpectedly after my last entry, I was able to trial Cards for Humanity at a dinner party which I stumbled upon. The atmosphere at this dinner was quite unlike anything I have experienced back in reality. There were around 60 guests, all with their own cutlery and utensils, sharing a large meal prepared by six or so volunteers. There was a round of speeches and open conversation before the feast. Many of the guests were heavily accessorised seeking I believe to divulge clues to their personality. I on the other hand must have looked rather plain by comparison.<p>The overall ambience was slightly feverish, a huge amount of energy being generated as people flocked from one to another sharing long hugs, warm embraces, broad smiles and friendly chatter. I took it upon myself to share in this mood, speaking to as many people as I could and indeed approaching a number of guests with my Cards for Humanity game.
					<p><p><p>With these Cytopians, discussion around the difference between awareness and intelligence arose fairly often. While some selected intelligence as a defining quality, others saw the difference between the two as crucial to humans compared to animals and machines, each of which have their own forms of intelligence but perhaps lack awareness and consciousness, especially in the case of machines, according to the players.</p>

					<p><div id="quotes">“Our ability to communicate in complex ways really sets us apart”</div><p>Communication was also something that was pointed to as a defining attribute, especially the way in which complex language has allowed us to develop and share ideas from generation to generation.</p>
					<p><div id="quotes">“Why did I pick Love? It’s obvious isn’t it”</div><p>Love was something that came up again and again. This was unexpected as my assumption was that cards like selfish and evil would be popular, though perhaps I should have been less surprised given what Gem told me. The strange thing was that most people I spoke with did not really provide a reason for selecting Love and stated that it was the obvious choice. The fact that this choice <em>seemed</em> so obvious makes me consider that perhaps this truly is a place where citizens are seeking utopia.</p><p>The answers I received were mostly in the realm of &lsquo;positive humanity&rsquo;. Overall the game seems to be a successful way to approach a difficult, nuanced topic with strangers in a strange land. It also has the bonus of being an excellent conversation starter and indeed I shared several long, interesting discussions with new friends. All in all a lot of fun!<p>For future iterations of the game I will be creating more props to bring the game to life, in a very literal sense.</p>
