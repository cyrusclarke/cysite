					<h1>Cards for Humanity</h1>
					<p><div id="quotes">This is an excerpt from the journal I kept during my initial three day stay in Cytopia.</div><p>I must say this morning I felt quite overwhelmed.<p>Even though most things are seemingly similar here, there are a huge number of small differences that I can&rsquo;t quite put my finger on, yet.</p><p>To investigate further I decided to try and approach people in an attempt to uncover insights into the characteristics of this world. This proved fruitless. Even though people were friendly enough, the moment I attempted to ask any pointed questions they seemed totally bemused. In retrospect blindsiding pedestrians and expecting them to divulge valuable information about the nature of their existence was particularly foolish. </p><p>In my frustration I decided to go for a walk along the water. Gazing into the deep blue, my thoughts turned to Gem&rsquo;s description of the people here as <i>Cyborgs</I>. Donna Harraway&rsquo;s list of contrasts sprang into my head. I realised I could employ something similar here and try to get to the root of what defines this Cytopian society.</p>

					To do so, I devised a game which I call &ldquo;Cards for Humanity&rdquo;. The initial game involves 30 cards, each of which feature a quality that could be attributed to a human, animal or indeed a machine. The qualities are: Attention, Awareness, Beliefs, Character, Class, Cleanliness, Communication, Connection, Creativity, Discipline, Dominion, Evil, Family, Gender, Habits, Intelligence, Kindness, Limits, Logic, Love, Movement, Neutrality, Opinions, Personality, Perception, Presence, Race, Religion, Selfishness, Senses and Soul.</p><p>The game asks people to choose just 3 qualities that really define a human-being â€” clarifying that this is not about creating the perfect human-being, just a representative one for society from the 30 cards provided. The idea being to try and isolate what it is people believe separates humans from animals and machines, if indeed anything does. </p><p>For fun, I cut these on to SD card forms to engender a slight sense of doubt about my intentions amongst the players. These cards were designed to be the antidote to my earlier errors, allowing me to operate guerrilla style seeking information in a playful manner. We will see how that plays out tomorow.</p>
