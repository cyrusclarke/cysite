				<h1>Back to Life</h1><p><p>
				Today I woke up in reality.<p>I knew this immediately as when I turned to my left I found a smartphone in front of my eyes with a long list of unopened notifications that I immediately was repulsed by. I rushed to my desk and upon opening my laptop saw that my normal applications and services were back. My immediate thought was to start downloading everything I had learned in Cytopia.</p><p>While in Cytopia my smartphone had not travelled with me. I had realised that several hours in when I reached into my pocket to check the time and realised that my iPhone was no longer with me. It also took me a while to find a reliable internet access point which I eventually found in the local library. In all honesty the internet was not something that I actively sought out, I suppose I was preoccupied with interacting with the people of the new world.</p><p>Knowing that my time would be limited, I used this initial trip to Cytopia for reconnaissance, speaking to as many people as I could. I had only been gone what must have three days but I had experienced so much. This Cytopian world, though similar to our own, had a great number of differences. My time there was characterised by frenzied scribbling and sketching in notepads. My trusty camera was also on hand to shoot photos and videos.</p>

				<p>The ideas that I came across have inspired me and completely changed my notions of reality. I have never felt so motivated to work to try and share these ideas through the means available to me. The momentum I felt this morning to immediately share everything I had experienced was quickly checked by the enormity of that challenge. I knew it would be close to impossible to make people understand in a straight-forward manner. Anything I divulge would likely be misconstrued as the talk of a crazy man and I am wary of this.</p><p>After some consideration, I have decided that I must split my focus into documenting research through this journal periodically, as well as exploring how I can use the technology of this reality to recreate some of the amazing upgrades I found in Cytopia. This will not be an easy task as the technology of this alternate reality has developed in a very different direction to that of our own, much like Gem had stated. What I had failed to understand was the power of this technology to shape entire systems, the way markets operate and ultimately people&#39;s behaviours.</p><p>It has by the same stroke made me much more appreciative of the good points of our reality. In many ways the experience has been a catalyst to help release some of the latent energy I have to advance thinking around &lsquo;how things could be.&rsquo;<p>After all Cytopia is just a case of what might have been.</p>
