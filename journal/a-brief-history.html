				<h1>A Brief History of Cytopia</h1><p><p>
				<p>After speaking with a number of people, and spending some time immersing myself in some of the amazing online tools available in Cytopia, including services like Wikipedia which we seem to share, I was able to outline what appears to me at least, to be a fairly succinct, accurate narrative around how the two worlds diverged.</p><p>Everything appears to have started around 1998. It seems that voices like <a href="http://goldhaber.org">Goldhaber</a>, relatively unknown in our reality, were listened to a great deal more in the Cytopian realm. His ideas about attention and the attention economy inspired waves of ingenious engineers, designers and others to create new systems which built upon the nascent technology of the world wide web, which at that time was becoming increasingly popular. They thought not only about the new models of technology that would emerge but also about the new models of markets that could arise around it. This gave rise to four eras of the internet, similar in number and dissimilar in nature to the four eras we are familiar with here in reality.</p>

				<p>Amusingly, to me at least, one of the key stories seems to involve a movement known as Att.Eco that grew from the dot-net domain. The dot-com, which is still the prevalent domain in our world, was increasingly viewed as corporate and belonging to an old-style of thinking. Sites with an alternative ideology sprang up, many adorning the declaration of independence of cyberspace and a dot-net domain. Their ideological differences from my research appear to have been around ownership and centralisation. These sites and services advocated and empowered the ownership of data by individual citizens, moving beyond copyright and rights protection in a traditional sense. Sharing became the keyword and the norm. Napster, a service many of us are familiar with, was the standard bearer of this movement, increasing awareness and innovating new models for sharing content, monetisation and identity. Although the domains in Cytopia have long since progressed beyond the simple dot-net, it is still viewed with nostalgia and reverence for having led to the Att.Eco movement and ultimately to what Cytopians now consider a golden age.</p>
				<p>Att.Eco and critical thinking about the development of the services from both a technological and business perspective led to a gradual decline in the previously emergent services of the late 90s and early 00s. This rebalancing appears to have been enough to avert what we experienced as a dot-com bubble bursting in 2001. The effect of this was to reduce the importance of purely economic factors for those undertaking net based ventures during this period, compared to what we witnessed here in reality. The outcomes were quite breathtaking.</p>
				<p>With the early 00s characterised by an era of Attention and Sharing, efforts were focused on developing new models to capitalise on this opportunity. Indeed someone we are very well acquainted with in this reality, Elon Musk was one of the major proponents of developments in this area. It appears that PayPal, though a contender, did not emerge during this time in Cytopia. Mr Musk rather than joining the board at Coinfinity, focused his efforts with Bill Harris at X.com on an alternative &ldquo;currency&rdquo; that captured the essence of the attention economy. This was the first instance of money-on-the-net and inspired by the wave of dot-nets they called the venture moo.net.*</p>
				<p>The system they created initially was simply to render explicit the value exchanges that occur implicitly while we interact with content online. Their thinking was that by creating an appreciable link between intent, action and response, as well as re-aligning incentives, a market would naturally develop and with it more considerate, mindful approaches. The structure that this was built on is something akin to what we see today being developed around our blockchain technology. I will provide further details of this system, its development and the consequences in future posts.</p>
				<p>Though traditional money has not totally disappeared, in 2016 the cach√© around Moo.nets appears to outweigh that of money. In the online world especially, this has led to very different consumptive and creative behaviours. Interestingly Moo.nets became available as printed legal tender. As Bill Harris&#39;s daughter was an avid campaigner for endangered animals, the team decided to emblazon the notes with depictions of some of the world&#39;s rarest species. This brought to citizens awareness the plight of nature, linking the numbers on the notes to the numbers of animals remaining in the wild.</p>

				<p>It appears to me that in light of this, we have applied old thinking to new phenomenon, unable to truly adapt our models to a world where the cost of reproduction falls to nearly zero, or where attention is the scarce resource in the face of overwhelming amounts of information. There are many voices in our reality who speak of this without having had the luxury of experiencing an alternate world and I admire them greatly for their perspicacity.</p><p>As time went on, as logic would predict, the realities grew further apart. The remaining ages that came following the Att.Eco led to an era of developments on the matter of Identity while we underwent the Social revolution. In the early 2010s while our internet giants embarked on IPOs and carefully merged with and acquired rivals, the decentralised companies of Cytopia began to focus increasingly on the notion of Attention Realities.</p><p>Though I could attempt to depict these developments here, I feel it is best to allow others to &lsquo;live&rsquo; as a Cytopian. To that end I will be experimenting over the next few weeks to create experiences that provide something comparable to that which the average Cytopian experiences on a daily basis.</p><p>*<i>In our reality moo.net is a website for cheese.</p></i>
