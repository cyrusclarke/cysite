					<h1>Calm</h1><p>
						<div id="quotes">&lsquo;A lone figure. Back turned. Receding into the mist.&rsquo;</div>
					<p>During a talk on an unrelated project, we were invited to share references around information technology innovations, particularly in the area of ubiquitous computing, something of course extremely pertinent when we consider the cyborg ecosystem.</p>

					</div><p>The idea of ubiquitous computing put forward by Mark Weiser (above) is that the best form of computer technology is that which is <q>invisible</q> - part of our surroundings and available on demand. This type of technology is able to respond to human needs; enabling tasks to be performed but without detracting from consciousness about what is being carried out.</p><p>This extends to the notion of &lsquo;calm-technology&rsquo; again a well-known term referring to technology which does not covet or demand attention. Given our now established love-hate relationship with technology, this sounds like the perfect antidote. Yet when one thinks of the real applications of calm-technology since the term was coined in the 90s, the results are strikingly low.</p><p>Although there are a lot of interesting experiments and developments in this area, the list of implemented examples is pretty short (of course not complete). Which leads me to wonder why something which seems so common-sense and fitting to human needs is not being pursued and adopted at the same rate as other forms of information technology.  </p><p>Perhaps now with the right combination of miniaturisation, mobile technology and to some extent awareness of the pitfalls of a type of ubiquitous computing not covered by Weiser&#39;s definition, there are opportunities to embed technology in our surroundings and within ourselves. Could this help us to avoid the information overload that comes with a hyper-informed state? Can we start to process information again using other tools than just screens and our eyes? Might information and communication technology finally relent from its attention seeking ways and finally deliver on its promise to become a non-intrusive part of our surroundings?</p><p>Far from turning our backs on new technology, my prototypes will look to challenge some of the assumed and given qualities of computers. This will certainly involve looking to deliver on some of the key principles of calm technology, focusing on qualities like attention and awareness. Conversely to many of today&#39;s most popular services, rather than prizing the capture of attention, I will look to give people back the ability to be aware, giving them the freedom to be attentive to what they consider important.</p>
